icon: Route
---

Manages an individual binding entry in `bindings[]`. Bindings route incoming messages from specific channels or peers to specific agents. This enables multi-agent setups where different channels talk to different agents.

## Example Usage

### Route Discord to a specific agent

```hcl
resource "openclaw_binding" "discord_research" {
  agent_id      = "research"
  match_channel = "discord"
}
```

### Route a specific Telegram user to an agent

```hcl
resource "openclaw_binding" "telegram_vip" {
  agent_id         = "coding"
  match_channel    = "telegram"
  match_account_id = "tg:123456789"
}
```

### Route DMs vs groups differently

```hcl
resource "openclaw_binding" "whatsapp_dm" {
  agent_id        = "personal"
  match_channel   = "whatsapp"
  match_peer_kind = "dm"
}

resource "openclaw_binding" "whatsapp_group" {
  agent_id        = "team"
  match_channel   = "whatsapp"
  match_peer_kind = "group"
}
```
