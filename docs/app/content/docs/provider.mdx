## Example Usage

### WebSocket Mode (Recommended)

Connect to a running OpenClaw gateway for live configuration:

```hcl
provider "openclaw" {
  gateway_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:18789"
  token       = var.gateway_token
}
```

### File Mode

Manage the config file directly without a running gateway:

```hcl
provider "openclaw" {
  config_path = "~/.openclaw/openclaw.json"
}
```

### Environment Variables Only

All provider attributes can be set via environment variables, allowing a zero-config provider block:

```hcl
provider "openclaw" {}
```

```bash
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL="ws://127.0.0.1:18789"
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="your-secret-token"
terraform apply
```

## Argument Reference

| Argument | Type | Description | Env Var | Default |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `gateway_url` | String | WebSocket URL of the OpenClaw gateway. When set, the provider uses WebSocket mode. | `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` | -- |
| `token` | String, Sensitive | Authentication token for the gateway WebSocket API. | `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | -- |
| `config_path` | String | Path to the `openclaw.json` config file. Used when `gateway_url` is not set. | `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` |

## Mode Selection

The provider automatically selects its transport mode:

1. If `gateway_url` is set (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL`), **WebSocket mode** is used. The provider connects to the gateway's WS RPC API and applies changes via `config.patch`.
2. Otherwise, **File mode** is used. The provider reads and writes the JSON config file at `config_path`.

### WebSocket Mode

- Requires a running OpenClaw gateway
- Changes are applied via the `config.patch` RPC
- Config reloads happen according to the gateway's `reload_mode` setting
- The `openclaw_health` data source is only available in this mode
- Supports authentication via `token`

### File Mode

- No running gateway required
- Reads and writes `openclaw.json` directly
- Uses a mutex to safely handle parallel resource operations
- The `openclaw_health` data source will return an error in this mode
- Useful for pre-provisioning configs before deploying the gateway

## Authentication

When the gateway has `gateway.auth.mode` set to `"token"`, you must provide the matching token:

```hcl
variable "gateway_token" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "openclaw" {
  gateway_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:18789"
  token       = var.gateway_token
}
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="your-secret-token"
```

If the gateway has no auth configured (`auth.mode = "none"`), the `token` argument can be omitted.
